Arcade is an application to help run game nights at home. It supports up to 24 players divided into 2-4 teams. Each player uses their phone as a controller, connecting via your local WiFi network.

> Arcade does not have production-grade security. I use this to host game nights for friends - you shouldn't expose this to the internet.


## Installation & setup

### Prerequisites
- The [Bun](https://bun.sh) javascript runtime
- A WiFi network where you have admin access to the router (for eg. your home WiFi)
- A computer to run the server
- A display device (TV/projector) for the main game screen
- Mobile phones for players

### Instructions
1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabirgh/arcade.git
   cd arcade
   bun install
   ```

1. **Set up configuration:**
Update `config.ts` with your WiFi credentials and server IP address. This is used to generate QR codes that players can scan to connect to the WiFi and join the game.

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   This starts both the server (port 3001) and frontend development server (port 5173).

1. **For production (compiled binary):**
   ```bash
   bun prod
   ```

1. **Connect devices:**
   - Display the main game on your TV at `http://{server.host}:{server.port}`
   - Players join by scanning QR code or navigating to the same URL on their phones
